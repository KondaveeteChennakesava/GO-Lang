// Named return values

// Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.
// These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.
// A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.
// Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.
